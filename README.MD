This is my implementation of the weeks 2-4 homework at Fundamentals of Programming.

If you're going to use it please change some stuff before.

Run it with (linux):

python3 -u main.py

Modules:
	
	main 			-> The main entry point for the program.
	
	App 			-> The main loop. Has the list of commands and the error catching.
	
	UI				-> Contains the user interface functio.
	
	Validators		-> Contains the validation of the arguments for the functions.
	
	Commands 		-> Contains the main functions of the programs.
	
	ComplexNumber	-> Various functions regarding complex number validations and operations.
	
					-> Those 2 can be exported as is.
	
	HelpCommands	-> Contains the information about how to use the program.
	
	Helper			-> Various functions used for filling the app with random data.
	
	Tests			-> Testing is mandatory for any app.(Don't worry, I hate them too.)
